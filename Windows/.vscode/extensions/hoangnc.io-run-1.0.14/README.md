## Configuration

**Make sure the executor PATH of each language is set in the environment variable.**
You could also add entry into 
* `io-run.executorMap.common` (Common/Linux)
* or `io-run.executorMap.darwin` (MacOS) 
* or `io-run.executorMap.win32` (Windows)

to set the compile/run/cleanup command of your executor.

e.g. To set the executor PATH for C++, Java and Python:
```json
"io-run.executorMap.common": {
    ".cpp": {
      "compileCmd": "g++ -g -O2 -std=gnu++11 -Wfatal-errors ${codeFile} -o ${codeFileNoExt}",
      "runCmd": "${dirCodeFileNoExt} <${inputFile} >${outputFile}",
      "cleanupCmd": "rm ${codeFileNoExt}",
      "errorTracer": "gdb"
    },
    ".java": {
      "compileCmd": "javac -encoding UTF-8 ${codeFile}",
      "runCmd": "java ${codeFileNoExt} <${inputFile} >${outputFile}",
      "cleanupCmd": "rm ${codeFileNoExt.class}"
    },
    ".py": {
      "runCmd": "python ${codeFile} <${inputFile} >${outputFile}"
    }
}
```
**Supported customized parameters**
  * $dir: The directory of the code file being run
  * $dirCodeFile: The full name of the code file being run
  * $dirCodeFileNoExt: The full name of the code file being run without its extension
  * $codeFile: The base name of the code file being run, that is the file without the directory
  * $codeFileNoExt: The base name of the code file being run without its extension

**Please take care of the back slash and the space in file path of the executor**
  * Back slash: please use `\\`
