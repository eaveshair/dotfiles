# Gruvbox Themes

This extension includes all gruvbox themes for Visual Studio Code.

> Designed as a bright theme with pastel 'retro groove' colors and light/dark mode switching in the way of solarized. The main focus when developing gruvbox was to keep colors easily distinguishable while still being pleasant on the eyes.

*— Pavel Pertsev, creator of gruvbox for Vim*
